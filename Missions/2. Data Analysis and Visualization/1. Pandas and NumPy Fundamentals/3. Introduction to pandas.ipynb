    "- The lack of support for column names forces us to frame questions as multi-dimensional array operations.\n",
    "- Support for only one data type per ndarray makes it more difficult to work with data that contains both numeric and string data.\n",
    "- There are lots of low level methods, but there are many common analysis patterns that don't have pre-built methods.\n",

    "### Understanding pandas and NumPy\n",

    "The primary data structure in pandas is called a __dataframe__. Dataframes are the pandas equivalent of a Numpy 2D ndarray, with a few key differences:\n",
    "- Axis values can have string __labels__, not just numeric ones.\n",
