    "Most data sets in real life require extensive cleaning and manipulation to extract any meaningful insights. In fact, Forbes estimates that data scientists spend about 60% of their time cleaning and organizing data, so it's critical to be able to manipulate data quickly and efficiently.\n",

    "We'll work with the World Happiness Report, an annual report created by the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network with the intent of guiding policy. The report assigns each country a happiness score based on the answers to a poll question that asks respondents to rank their life on a scale of 0 - 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also includes estimates of factors that may contribute to each country's happiness, including economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity, to provide context for the score. Although these factors aren't actually used in the calculation of the happiness score, they can help illustrate why a country received a certain score.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Goal:__ We'll work to answer the following questions:\n",
    "- How can aggregating the data give us more insight into happiness scores?\n",
    "- How did world happiness change from 2015 to 2017?\n",
    "- Which factors contribute the most to the happiness score?\n",
