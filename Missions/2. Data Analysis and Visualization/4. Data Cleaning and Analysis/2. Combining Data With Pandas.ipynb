    "Did world happiness increase, decrease, or stay about the same from 2015 to 2017?\n",
    "```\n",
    "As a reminder, these reports assign each country a happiness score based on a poll question that asks respondents to rank their life on a scale of 0 - 10, so \"world happiness\" refers to this definition specifically.\n",

    "- `Country` - Name of the country\n",
    "- `Region` - Name of the region the country belongs to\n",
    "- `Happiness Rank` - The rank of the country, as determined by its happiness score\n",
    "- `Happiness Score` - A score assigned to each country based on the answers to a poll question that asks respondents to rate their happiness on a scale of 0-10"
